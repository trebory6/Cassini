# Cassini
A Saturn 4 Ultra Remote Monitoring Tool

Cassini is a Python Script that automatically finds the Saturn 4 Ultra on the network then recieves status updates in json format. 

This is very much a work in progress, and honestly my first actual coding project, so I expect this to be rough around the edges. 

I am creating this to be able to be run on a Raspberry Pi, and from there will eventually be able to hook into an app on a phone. But it can be run on anything that supports Python.
